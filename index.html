			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
			My name is Brandon Chang, and I currently reside in the center of Koreatown in Los Angeles, California. Graduating with a Bachelors of Arts in English with the Class of 2015 I quickly got my first job outside of school. While working as an Underwriting Assistant with a nearby insurance brokerage, I was quickly accustomed and started to think of ways to optimize and ultimately streamline the process that I saw as rather inefficient. I quickly adapted my own past hobbies of automating and optimizing the general workflow on whatever task I have assigned to me, and found a renewed interest in venturing into programming. Fast forward a few months, and I've taken the initiative to learn various means to automate and optimize various processes that I find to be the most efficient in whatever tasks I'm responsible for.

			<p>
			People describe me as an innovative individual who has a clear attention-to-detail, always taking the initiative on possible methods to improve the general quality of life, be it games, work, or generally anything that I've an interest in.
